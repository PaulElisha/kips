# Simple summary

Priority fee mechanism for transaction type 2 (EthereumDynamicFee) in terms of transaction ordering.

# Abstract

Activate the priority fee mechanism as defined in the EIP-1559. The maxPriorityFeePerGas field of transaction type 2 is no longer a placeholder, now it represents the priority fee the sender is willing to pay. The transactions are ordered by descending effective gas price, which is usually in the descending priority fee order. Under congested network, high priority transactions can be included to block by declaring high priority fee.

# Motivation

TBU

# Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Block processing

### Effective gas price and effective priority fee per gas

The effective gas price and effective priorirty fee per gas of a transaction at given block are calculated as follows. The effective gas price is the actual price of gas paid by the sender.

```py
def EffectiveGasPrice(header: Header, tx: Transaction):
    if tx.type == 2:  # EthereumDynamicFee type
        maxPriorityFeePerGas = tx.maxPriorityFeePerGas
        maxFeePerGas = tx.maxFeePerGas
    else:
        maxPriorityFeePerGas = tx.gasPrice
        maxFeePerGas = tx.gasPrice

    return min(header.baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas)

def EffectivePriorityFeePerGas(header: Header, tx: Transaction):
    effectiveGasPrice = EffectiveGasPrice(header, tx)
    return effectiveGasPrice - header.baseFeePerGas
```

### KIP-82 reward scheme

The [KIP-82](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-82.md) reward scheme is slightly modified. The `get_total_fee` now accounts for effective gas price. Otherwise remains the same.

```py
def get_total_fee(header, txs, receipts):
    if header.number >= DRAGON_BLOCK_NUMBER:
        totalFee = 0
        for i in range(len(txs)):
            totalFee += EffectiveGasPrice(header, txs[i]) * receipts[i].gasUsed
        return totalFee
    elif header.number >= MAGMA_BLOCK_NUMBER:
        return header.GasUsed * header.BaseFee
    else:
        return header.GasUsed * config.UnitPrice
```

### EVM opcodes

- The `GASPRICE (0x3a)` opcode returns the effective gas price of the currently executing transaction.
- The `BASEFEE (0x48)` opcode remains the same. Returns the base fee per gas of the currently executing block.

## Transaction ordering

Transaction ordering depends on client implementation as the ordering is not checked by block validators. However, under the KIP-82 reward scheme, a proposer should prioritize high priority fee transactions for maximum proposer reward.

Block proposers are recommended to order transactions with descending effective gas price, and the same effective gas price are sorted by transaction arrival time. This discourages the transaction spamming where a sender sends many transactions hoping that at least one is included in the block. Instead, the sender would pay a higher priority fee to ensure the transaction be included in the block.

## JSON-RPC API

### `eth_gasPrice` and `klay_gasPrice`

Returns suggested value for `gasPrice` or `maxFeePerGas` fields of a transaction.

- Parameters: none
- Result: Recommended gas price in peb. The result depends on the client implementation.
- Example
  ```sh
  curl $RPC_URL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_gasPrice","params":[]}'

  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xba43b7400"}
  ```

### `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `klay_maxPriorityFeePerGas`

Returns suggested value for `gasPrice` or `maxFeePerGas` fields of a transaction.

- Parameters: none
- Result: Recommended priority fee per gas in peb. The result depends on the client implementation.
- Example
  ```sh
  curl $RPC_URL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas","params":[]}'

  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x3b9aca00"}
  ```

### `eth_feeHistory` and `klay_feeHistory`

Returns historical gas information for a range of blocks.

- Parameters
  - `blockCount` - Number of blocks in the requested range.
  - `newestBlock` - Highest block of the requested range. Can be a number or "latest".
  - `rewardPercentiles` - (optional) A monotonically increasing list of percentile (between 0 and 100) values. For each block in the requested range, the transactions will be sorted in ascending order by effective tip per gas and sampled at the specified percentiles.
- Result
  - `oldestBlock` - Lowest number block of returned range.
  - `baseFeePerGas` - An array of block base fee per gas. This includes the next block after the newest of the returned range, because this value can be derived from the newest block. Zeroes are returned for pre-Magma blocks.
  - `gasUsedRatio` - An array of block gas used ratios. Measures the network congestion level. These are calculated as the ratio of block gas used and [KIP-71 MAX_BLOCK_GAS_USED_FOR_BASE_FEE](https://github.com/klaytn/kips/blob/main/KIPs/kip-71.md). If the ratio is above 1, then 1.0 is returned.
  - `reward` - A 2D array of effective priority fees per gas. `reward[n][i]` is the `rewardPercentiles[i]`-th percentile effective priority fees per gas among the transactions in the block `oldestBlock + n`.
- Example
  ```sh
  curl $RPC_URL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_feeHistory","params":[
      4,
      "latest",
      [50.0, 90.0, 95.0]
    ]}'

  {
    "id": "1",
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
      "oldestBlock": "0x8e0a025",
      "baseFeePerGas": ["0x5d21dba00", "0x5d21dba00", "0x5d21dba00", "0x61c9f3680"],
      "gasUsedRatio": [0.023, 0.31, 1.0, 0.88],
      "reward": [
        ["0x3b9aca00", "0x3b9aca00", "0x9502f900"],
        ["0x3b9aca00", "0x3b9aca00", "0x9502f900"],
        ["0x3b9aca00", "0x9502f900", "0x2e90edd00"],
        ["0x3b9aca00", "0x9502f900", "0x30e4f9b40"],
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

# Rationale

## A KIP-71 parameter is used in place of block gas limit

The Ethereum's `eth_feeHistory` calculates gasUsedRatio as `block.gasUsed/blockGasLimit`. But Klaytn does not have hard limit of block gas. Instead, Klaytn's MAX_BLOCK_GAS_USED_FOR_BASE_FEE is analogous to Ethereum's block gas limit.

In Ethereum, block gas limit is 30,000,000 and the base fee starts to rise when the block gas used exceeds 15,000,000 (`block.gasLimit / ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER`). Similartly, in the Klaytn's initial KIP-71 parameters the block gas used is only accounted until 60,000,000 (`MAX_BLOCK_GAS_USED_FOR_BASE_FEE`) and the base fee starts to rise when the block gas used exceeds 30,000,000 (`GAS_TARGET`).

# Backward compatibility

## Other transaction types

Legacy (type 0) transactions, EIP-2920 AccessList (type 1) transactions, and Klaytn transaction types (types 8+) will work and be included in blocks. Those transactions have `gasPrice` field but no `maxFeePerGas` nor `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields. The transaction's `gasPrice` will be fully paid because `effectiveGasPrice = min(baseFeePerGas + gasPrice, gasPrice) = gasPrice`.

These transactions may experience sudden increase in gas costs because previously they only paid `baseFeePerGas` but now they have to pay `gasPrice`. To reduce the impact, `eth_gasPrice` implementations may return a number slightly higher than the `baseFeePerGas`.
